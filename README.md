# NutriSense AI  üç¥

NutriSense AI is a smart nutrition assistant powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Designed to simplify healthy eating, it generates personalized recipes and provides detailed nutritional insights tailored to user preferences and dietary goals. 

## Features  
- **Personalized Recipe Generation**: Create recipes based on user-provided ingredients or dietary requirements.  
- **Nutritional Analysis**: Offers a comprehensive breakdown of recipes, including calorie counts and nutrient composition.  
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Seamless user experience through a chatbot interface built with **Chainlit**.  
- **Globally Representative Dataset**: Ensures inclusivity by leveraging diverse food and nutrition data.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**: For data processing and backend development.  
- **Seaborn**: To create visualizations for nutrient vs. calorie density analysis.  
- **Tableau**: For visualizing key insights and user data.  
- **Chainlit**: To build an intuitive chatbot interface for user interaction.  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: For recipe generation and personalization.  

## Architecture  
1. **Data Processing**:  
   - Uses globally representative datasets to analyze food origin and nutritional content.  
2. **Model Integration**:  
   - LLMs are fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks to generate recipes and nutritional insights.  
3. **User Interaction**:  
   - An interactive chatbot ensures seamless communication with users.  

## Key Insights  
- Identified the relationship between nutrient density (e.g., fiber, Vitamin C) and calorie content to promote balanced dietary choices.  
- Highlighted nutrient-rich foods from diverse regions, ensuring inclusivity in recommendations.  

## Technical Learnings  
1. **Prompt Engineering**: Enhanced LLM outputs for domain-specific, actionable dietary suggestions.  
2. **User-Centric Design**: Balanced model accuracy with usability for an intuitive experience.  

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ArushiMakraria/llm-powered-nutritionist.git  
   cd llm-powered-nutritionist  

## Future Scope
